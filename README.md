levent
======
levent is a lua concurrency networking library inspired by [gevent](http://www.gevent.org/).

Features include:

* Fast event loop based on [libev](http://libev.schmorp.de/).
* Simple and clean socket library
* Cooperative dns client by pure lua
* Similar api and components with gevent but with much more simpler implementation and better performance.

code example
------------

levent's api is clean, to request http concurrently is as simple as below:

```lua
lua <<SCRIPT
local levent = require "levent.levent"
local http   = require "levent.http"

local urls = {
    "http://www.google.com",
    "http://yahoo.com",
    "http://example.com",
    "http://qq.com",
}

function request(url)
    local response, err = http.get(url)
    if not response then
        print(url, "error:", err)
    else
        print(url, response:get_code())
    end
end

function main()
    for _, url in ipairs(urls) do
        levent.spawn(request, url)
    end
end

levent.start(main)
SCRIPT
```

for multi-thread see `tests/test_socket_thread.lua`.
